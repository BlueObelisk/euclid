			INPUT:
			Input stream (Files, directories, URLs), Norma tries to guess reasonable actions. 
				also expands some simple wildcards. The argument can either be a single object, or a list. Within objects
				the content of curly brackets {...} is expanded as wildcards (cannot recurse). There can be multiple {...}
				within an object and all are expanded (but be sensible - this could generate the known universe and crash the
				system. (If this is misused it will be withdrawn). Objects (URLs, files) can be mixed but it's probably a
				poor idea.
				
				The logic is: 
				(a) if an object starts with 'www' or 'http:' or 'https;' it's assumed to be a URL
				(b) if it is a directory, then the contents (filtered by extension) are added to the list as files
				(c) if it's a file it's added to the list
				the wildcards in files and URLs are then expanded and the results added to the list
				
				Current wildcards:
				  {n1:n2} n1,n2 integers: generate n1 ... n2 inclusive
				  {foo,bar,plugh} list of strings

			suppdata.pdf ? // supplemental data
			
			and more
			
			only results.json is mandatory. However there will normally be at least one fulltext.* file and probably at 
			least one *.html file (as the landing page must be in HTML). Since quickscrape can extract data without 
			fulltext it might also be deployed against a site with data files.
			
			There may be some redundancy - *.xml may be transformable into *.html and *.pdf into *.html. The PDF may also 
			contain the same images as some exposed *.png.
